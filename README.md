# My-Website

A website entirely about me!

This website serves the purpose of letting the world know a little more about **me** and what I like to do.

# Setting up the working environment

So, first things first

* Clone the repo
* Make sure you have npm installed on your machine
* Go to the cloned folder and run, `npm install`
* Now run, `npm run`
* To start the server go to the src directory and run `node server.js`
* Open a browser and go to localhost:8080, the website should now be up and running.

If you are behind a proxy do not forget to put proxy settings for npm.
This can be done by doing,

* npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
* npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
