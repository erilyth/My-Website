# Setting up the working environment

So, first things first

* Clone the repo
* Make sure you have npm installed on your machine
* Go to the cloned folder and run, `npm install`
* Use `npm sass` to compile .sass into .css
* To start the server use, `npm start`
* Open a browser and go to localhost:8080, the website should now be up and running.

If you are behind a proxy do not forget to put proxy settings for npm.
This can be done by doing,

* npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
* npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
* npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
