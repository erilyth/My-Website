# Setting up the working environment

So, first things first

* Clone the repo [Thats obvious :p]
* Make sure you have npm installed on your machine
* Go to the cloned folder and do npm install
* Then do npm run
* You are done
* To run the server go to the src folder and do node server.js
* Open a browser and go to localhost:8080
* And Voila !! You are done

If you are behind a proxy do not forget to put proxy settings for npm

This can be done by doing

* npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
* npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
